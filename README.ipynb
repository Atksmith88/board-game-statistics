    "An Analysis of Board Game Statistics<br><br>\n",
    "In the last few decades, the popularity of board games has exploded, along with the number and variety of board games available. Many have said that we're now in a Golden Age of board games. The purpose of this project is to examine the statistics of thousands of available board games as well as their ratings (via boardgamegeek.com) in order to predict how well a newly released board game might rate amongst players based on its features such as category, mechanics, complexity, playing time, and number of players. <br><br>\n",
    "<b>Question:</b> Given a number of board game features, what is the rating that board game is expected to receive?<br><br>\n",
    "<b>Why?</b> As stated above, the popularity of board games has exploded in the last few decades, with new board games being created and developed daily, if not hourly. Analyzing the tens of thousands of existing games and their ratings in order to help future board game developers pin down things they could change, remove, or add to their games in order to increase their potential ratings, and thus the popularity of their game, can only help the genre as a whole.<br><br>\n",
    "<b>Process:</b> The dataset was obtained from <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/mandshaw/games-0918'>Kaggle</a> and was gathered from <a href='https://www.boardgamegeek.com'>Board Game Geek</a>. This data was investigated and cleaned, then analyzed and engineered, combining multiple categories and mechanics to reduce overall dimensionality without sacrificing too much data. A base model was created, followed by multiple model tests to select the best initial option, and finally that best model was iterated upon to achieve the best rating predictions.\n",

    "The Metadata column contained another large number of features, including Artist, Category, Integration, Expansion, Family, Publisher, Mechanic, and Designer. This column was blown out so that each additional feature had its own column.<br><br>\n",
    "The formatted data was reduced to Name, Year Published, Minimum and Maximum Players, Minimum Age, Playing Time (and Minimum and Maximum), Number of Users Rating, Average Rating, Total Owners, Total User Weights, Average Weight, and the Category and Mechanic columns from the Metadata, both of which were one-hot encoded so that each Category and each Mechanic had its own column, resulting in 148 total feature columns.<br><br>\n",
    "The final dataset used for modeling dropped Minimum and Maximum Playing Time, Number of Users Rating, Total Owners, and Total User Weights, and combined multiple Category features and multiple Mechanic features, resulting in 93 feature columns.\n",

As Weight has to do with the complexity of the game, ~2 seemed to be a good choice, as 1 is intended for children, and 3 is starting to get into the more complex games, with 4 and 5 being reserved for games that take a long time to learn, setup, or play.<br><br>   \n",
    "    For Playing Time, since it was equivalent to the Maximum Playing Time across the board, any rows with 0 that had something in Minimum Playing Time were replaced with their associated Minimum Playing Time, otherwise they were left as 0, since playing time can vary wildly across games, and trying to fill in with a mean, median, or mode just didn't feel right.<br><br>\n",
