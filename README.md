Investigating statistics regarding board games.

## Abstract
An Analysis of Board Game Statistics

In the last few decades, the popularity of board games has exploded, along with the number and variety of board games available. Many have said that we're now in a Golden Age of board games. The purpose of this project is to examine the statistics of thousands of available board games as well as their ratings (via boardgamegeek.com) in order to predict how well a newly released board game might rate amongst players based on its features such as category, mechanics, complexity, playing time, and number of players.
